MakersBnb is an application which allows users to list spaces they have available, and to hire spaces for the night. If a user wishes to host their own Space, they should be able to provide a name, description, price per night and a range of available dates. If a user wishes to book a space, they should be able to view all available spaces, descriptions, prices and select the available dates.

Once a date has been booked and approved, the available dates should no longer be available. Until the date has been confirmed, the space should remain available for that night.
